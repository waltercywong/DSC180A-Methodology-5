### Project 2 Proposal Prompts

1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
 - The most interesting part topic covered so far has been the intricacies and 
 complexities involved in chip design at an industry level. In particular the 
 problem with yield and faulty chips. The idea that it can be predicted where 
 along the wafer chips are more likely to malfunction and that there are ways 
 to optimize for less defects was eye-opening.
2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 
2 Project.
 - One possible investigation is looking into making the messages of certain 
 long-range nodes more salient and significant. The DE-HNN paper tackles this 
 problem with a hierarchy of virtual nodes that aggreagates messages across 
 nodes of the same netlist. One possible solution I have brainstormed is to 
 perform many long random walks that traverse across netlists, and using the 
 most common nodes traversed from these walks to create dummy nodes between 
 them and source node to more effectively receive its message.
3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current 
Quarter 1 Project?
 - Our Quarter 1 Project is simply re-implementing the DE-HNN project. 
 Therefore, the investigation I proposed above would involve changing my 
 approach for the Quarter 1 Project.
4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
 - I would be interested in applying more deep learning models towards 
 generating a better representation of chips, netlists, and corresponding 
 congestion. One possible approach is using CNNs to analyze not an actual 
 picture of the chip, but that of an IC layout.
